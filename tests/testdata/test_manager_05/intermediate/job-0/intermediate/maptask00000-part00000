is	1
a	1
tool	1
of	1
exchange	1
which	1
cant	1
exist	1
unless	1
there	1
are	1
goods	1
produced	1
and	1
men	1
able	1
to	1
produce	1
them	1
money	1
is	1
the	1
material	1
shape	1
of	1
the	1
principle	1
that	1
men	1
who	1
wish	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
one	1
another	1
must	1
deal	1
by	1
trade	1
and	1
give	1
value	1
for	1
value	1
money	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
tool	1
of	1
the	1
moochers	1
who	1
claim	1
your	1
product	1
by	1
tears	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
looters	1

by	1
force	1
money	1

made	1
possible	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
men	1
who	1

this	1
what	1
you	1
consider	1
evil	1
	1
have	1
you	1
ever	1
looked	1
for	1
the	1
root	1
of	1
production	1
take	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
an	1
electric	1
generator	1
and	1
dare	1
tell	1
yourself	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
created	1
by	1
the	1
muscular	1
effort	1
of	1
unthinking	1
brutes	1
try	1
to	1
grow	1
a	1
seed	1
of	1
wheat	1
without	1
the	1
knowledge	1
left	1
to	1
you	1
by	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
to	1
discover	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
try	1
to	1
obtain	1
your	1
food	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
physical	1
motions	1
and	1
youll	1
learn	1
that	1
mans	1
mind	1
is	1
the	1
root	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
goods	1
produced	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
wealth	1
that	1
has	1
ever	1
existed	1
on	1
earth	1
	1
to	1
trade	1
by	1

of	1
money	1
is	1
the	1
code	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
good	1
will	1
money	1
rests	1
on	1
the	1
axiom	1
that	1
every	1
man	1
is	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
his	1
mind	1
and	1
his	1
effort	1
money	1
allows	1
no	1
power	1
to	1
prescribe	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
your	1
effort	1
except	1
the	1
voluntary	1
choice	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
willing	1
to	1
trade	1
you	1
his	1
effort	1
in	1
return	1
money	1
permits	1
you	1
to	1
obtain	1
for	1
your	1
goods	1
and	1
your	1
labor	1
that	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
worth	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
buy	1
them	1
but	1
no	1
more	1
money	1
permits	1
no	1
deals	1
except	1
those	1
to	1
mutual	1
benefit	1

demands	1
of	1
you	1
the	1
recognition	1
that	1
men	1
must	1
work	1
for	1
their	1
own	1
benefit	1
not	1
for	1
their	1
own	1
injury	1
for	1
their	1
gain	1
not	1
their	1
loss	1
the	1
recognition	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
beasts	1
of	1
burden	1
born	1
to	1
carry	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
your	1
misery	1
that	1
you	1
must	1
offer	1
them	1
values	1
not	1
wounds	1
that	1
the	1
common	1
bond	1
among	1
men	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
exchange	1
of	1
suffering	1
but	1
the	1
exchange	1
of	1
goods	1
money	1
demands	1
that	1
you	1
sell	1
not	1
your	1
weakness	1
to	1
mens	1
stupidity	1
but	1
your	1
talent	1
to	1
their	1
reason	1
it	1
demands	1
that	1
you	1
buy	1
not	1
the	1
shoddiest	1
they	1
offer	1
but	1
the	1
best	1
that	1
your	1
money	1
can	1
find	1
and	1
when	1
men	1
live	1
by	1
trade	1
with	1
reason	1
not	1
force	1
as	1
their	1
final	1
arbiter	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
product	1
that	1
wins	1
the	1
best	1
performance	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
best	1
judgment	1
and	1
highest	1
ability	1
and	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
a	1

productiveness	1
is	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
his	1
reward	1
this	1
